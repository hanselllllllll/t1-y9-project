                A reporter named Monique has been chosen to write about Evelyn Hugo, a famous movie star. When she arrives, she finds out that Evelyn does not want the interview. She chose Monique to write her life story for reasons unknown. Since she was little Evelyn was forced to change herself and had an abusive father, she escaped by marrying Ernie and going to Hollywood. She gets her big debut by seducing an executive and she goes through many marriages and divorces for publicity. But Evelyn felt a real connection with Celia in “little woman”. They both have feelings for each other yet need to keep their relationship a secret. To counter any claims Evelyn marries Mick Riva and accidentally gets pregnant. She aborted it but that made Celia angry so she left Evelyn for 5 years. After a few years Evelyn seems to have a new husband, a child, and reunite with Celia. This point of her life is the start of the decline, she and Celia break up again, she divorced again, and marries another guy. Celia says that she has less than 10 years to live and harry gets into a drunk driving accident. Evelyn had to move in with Celia and her brother. So, at present time she reveals that she has outlived everyone she loves and has cancer herself. Monique was picked to write her story because er father was Harry’s boyfriend, the one that was blamed for the accident. Evelyn soon ends her own life rather than battling cancer and Monique shares that her love was never to her numerous husbands, but to Celia.

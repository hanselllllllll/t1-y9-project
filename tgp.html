                S1 = “the good place” is run by Micheal and his personal assistant Janet. Everyone there gets their soulmate and everything seems perfect, but Eleanor feels like she doesn’t belong. Soon after we find out that someone named Jason also thinks he’s on the wrong place. So, Eleanor and Jason try to be a better person to fit in with the help of their “soulmates”, Chidi a moral philosopher, and Tahani, a wealthy upper-class citizen. At the end of the season, it is revealed that all 4 of them are in the bad place and Micheal is a devil, planning to emotionally and psychologically torture them for eternity.
S2 = Micheal tries to redo and save the experiment but the squad always figures out they are in the bad place. After a while one of his demons threatens to rat him out, and that makes Micheal work together with the humans, promising them a place in the good place. Because of the time they spent together Micheal realizes that humans can actually change, this motivate him to do good and proposed the idea to judge Gen. The judge sends the 4 humans back to see if they can change.
S3 = As they carry out the experiment and learn about ethics together Micheal modifies a few things here and there to keep the experiment going. Demons from the bad place also made their way to the world and also tried to alter their endings. Eventually he gets caught and he explains the afterlife to the group, making them help others. They also find out that the system they use to sort humans is flawed and needs to change.
S4 = They make another experiment trying to prove that people can actually change after their death. After the experiment all 3 parties discuss a better way to grade humans’ goodness. At the end the squad and Micheal earned their spot in the good place and arrive only to realize that the good place has turned numb and meaningless, so they let people exit peacefully and end their afterlife. At the end Eleanor Chidi and Jason went peacefully while Tahani stayed to be a designer for the new system and Micheal can experience being human.

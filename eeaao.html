                Evelyn Quang Wang is a Chinese American immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond, and has a daughter named Joy. Their laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). And since its Chinese New Year Evelyns father, gongong is coming to visit. To top onto all the chaos, Waymond also wants a divorce. It’s quite obvious that the family is going through something rough. Joy’s relationship isn’t any better too, she has a non – Chinese girlfriend that is not necessarily accepted. At the IRS, alpha-Waymond takes over his body and tells Evelyn about the alpha verse. He tells her that every decision makes a new universe and you can access that version of them with verse-jumping. He’s saying all this because Jobu Tupaki aka alpha-Joy has created an everything bagel that can destroy the multiverse. She does this because she was pushed to verse-jump too much and now experiences every universe at the same time. Apparently, Evelyn is the worst version of herself so she’s so bad she can do anything. As she’s fighting and learning how to verse-jump alpha-Gong gong takes over and says she should just kill her Joy so that Jobu can’t access her universe, but Evelyn declines. Now alpha-Gong gong also thinks she verse-jumped too much and is corrupted like Jobu. At that point Jobu actually killed alpha-Waymond and is now going to Evelyn. As they meet, Evelyn’s mind is fractured and verse-jumps with Jobu together. Jobu just wants to find an Evelyn that sees things the way she does, that nothing matters. She invites Evelyn to the everything bagel and Evelyn’s actually persuaded and agrees to Jobus view. While her and Jobu is entering the bagel, she hears Waymonds plead at her original universe. Waymond just wants everyone to get along and be nice, even when life is hard. Evelyn has an epiphany on how she should view the world and now fights to win back Jobu. So, as she fights and repair all the damages in her other universes, she reconciles on her original universe. She tells Joy and Jobu that even when life is rough, she would always want to be with her. Jobu is saved from the bagel and they both start to embrace their love.

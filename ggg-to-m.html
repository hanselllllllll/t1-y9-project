                A few years ago, the tragic death of Andie bell happened. Sal, Andie’s boyfriend, was suspected to be the killer. After a while Sal actually killed himself and supposedly admitted the crime to his dad. And because of that the case was closed even though they did not find Andie’s body. Pip believes that there is still more to the story so she does her own investigation and after a few interviews Sal’s brother, Ravi, decides to tag along. While investigating, pip keeps getting notes telling her stop. Her dog was unfortunately killed because of it. Long story short they found out that Becca is the killer, they had an argument at the night of the death and Andie unfortunately died because of falling and convulsion.

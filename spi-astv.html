                The story starts off with Gwen forced to reveal her identity to her dad and joining the spider society with Miguel and Jess. In miles world he meets The Spot, a villain who got infused with the portal from the last movies ending. He says that miles is the cause of his condition and aims to destroy him, but he accidentally learned that he can go through other universes with his portals. So, the spot goes to universes getting more power from their own colliders. Gwen enters miles universe to track The Spot but miles follows her to another universe and learns about the spider society. At that universe the spot successfully gets the collider and everything starts to fall apart because miles saved someone, disrupting a canon event. They go back to the spider societyâ€™s headquarters and miles learns what a canon event is. He realizes that his dad, Jeff, getting killed by the spot is a canon event so he tries to escape. Miguel traps him but he still fled, potentially harming the whole multiverse. Miguel sends Gwen back but at her universe she finds out that canon events can be avoided, knowing that she tries to help miles by making her own group with a portal watch she got. Miles actually went to Earth-42, the original universe the spider that bit him is from. In this universe Miles is the prowler and uncle Aaron is alive while Jeff is dead since there is no spider-man. And to top it all of The Spot is ready to start his multiversal attack.

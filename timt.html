                This is me trying is a song that creates a story about a person facing many different kinds of battles. They are going through a decline and almost committed suicide in the first verse : “Pulled the car off the road to the lookout. Could've followed my fears all the way down”. This person also keeps trying to recover and get back to their previous, better state. “I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere. Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here”, they keep comparing themselves to others, not giving any credit to themselves. Despite all of that they are still trying and doing the best they can but no one is there to acknowledge their struggles and efforts.
